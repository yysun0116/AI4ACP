# AI4ACP
AI4ACP is a sequence-based anticancer peptides (ACPs) predictor based on the combination of the [PC6 protein-encoding method](https://github.com/LinTzuTang/PC6-protein-encoding-method "link") and deep learning model.

AI4ACP (web-server) is freely accessible at <https://axp.iis.sinica.edu.tw/AI4ACP/>

## 1. Quick demo of AI4ACP model
For qick demo of our model, run the command below:
'''bash
bash AI4ACP/test/example.sh
'''
  The input file of this demo is a FASTA file (example_seq.fasta) with 10 peptide sequences.
  The output file of this demo is a CSV file (test/example_output.csv), which is composed of the sequence identities, the prediction scores, and the prediction results.
